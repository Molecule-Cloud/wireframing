# Wireframing
* Wireframes are visual representations of the skeletal framework of a website or design. They can be defined as the blueprint of a software interface that oulines the layout structure, key components, user flow and content placement.

## Importance of Wireframing in SDLC:
* **Early Visualization**:
- Turns abstract requirements into tangible layouts before coding.
- Helps stakeholders stay aligned on design expectations.

* **Saves Time and Cost**:
- Catches usablity issues early and reduces the cost involved in fixing am already coded frontend of a software.

* **Clarifies Funtionality**:
- Wireframes map user jouneys and defines user interactions with the software.

* **Improves Collaboration**:
- Wireframes keep designers, developers, and clients on a single reference ad reduces misinterpretations.

## Key Elements in a Wireframe
* **Layout Grid and Containers:
*The Layout grid and containers define the hierarchy of the dsign while ensuring consistency in spacing*

* Navigation:
*These include elements like menus and buttons. They helpd deine how users move through the app*

* Placeholder Content:
*This can be in the form of dummy text or image boxes. Its purpose is to indicate content type, allowing stakeholders to visualise design patterns.*

* Form Fields and Inputs:
*These help indicate data collection points easily. They include checkboxes, dropdowns, textboxes, form fields, etc.*

* CTA (Call to Action) Buttons:
*They come in the form of buttons like sign up, cancel, subscribe, etc, which guide users towards key actions.*

* Icons and Symbols:
*Icons like hamburger icons, cart icons, etc enhances usuability with familiar visual cues.

## **Types of Wireframes**  

### **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  
* Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, schematic representations that focus purely on layout and structure without visual details. These wireframes typically use basic shapes, placeholder text, and grayscale elements to outline the placement of key components like headers, buttons, and content blocks. Designers often create them quickly using pen and paper or digital tools like Balsamiq during the early stages of a project. The primary purpose of low-fidelity wireframes is to facilitate rapid iteration and gather feedback on fundamental concepts before committing to specific design choices.

### **High-Fidelity Wireframes**  
* High-fidelity wireframes are detailed, polished representations that closely resemble the final product. They incorporate actual content, precise spacing, typography, and sometimes even basic interactivity like clickable buttons. Designers create these wireframes using advanced tools like Figma during later stages of the design process. High-fidelity wireframes serve multiple purposes: they help stakeholders visualize the near-final product, enable user testing with realistic prototypes, and provide developers with accurate specifications for implementation.

### **When to Use Each Type**  
* Low-fidelity wireframes are ideal during the initial phases of a project when the focus is on exploring ideas and establishing the foundational layout. They allow teams to make quick changes and pivot directions without wasted effort. In contrast, high-fidelity wireframes become valuable once the basic structure is validated and the team needs to refine details like visual hierarchy, micro-interactions, and responsive behavior. Transitioning from low to high fidelity ensures that time-intensive design work only begins after solving major usability questions.  


## **Wireframing Tools**  

### **Figma (Recommended)**  
Figma has emerged as the industry-leading wireframing and prototyping tool due to its robust feature set and cloud-based collaboration. Unlike traditional design software, Figma operates in the browser and also offers desktop app performance. Key features include vector networks for precise shape editing, auto-layout for responsive designs, and reusable component libraries that maintain consistency across screens.  
What makes Figma particularly valuable for wireframing is its real-time collaboration capability, where multiple team members can simultaneously edit files while seeing each other’s cursors and changes. The tool also supports interactive prototyping with transitions and animations, allowing designers to create clickable wireframes for usability testing. Figma provides an end-to-end solution that adapts to all stages of the design process.  

### **Alternative Wireframing Tools**  

* #### **Balsamiq**  
* Specializing in rapid low-fidelity wireframing, Balsamiq mimics hand-drawn sketches with its deliberately rough visual style. This approach helps stakeholders focus on structure rather than aesthetics during early discussions. The drag-and-drop interface requires minimal learning, making it ideal for non-designers. However, it lacks Figma’s interactivity and high-fidelity capabilities.  

* #### **Adobe XD**  
* Adobe’s dedicated UX/UI tool offers powerful vector design and prototyping features. Tight integration with other Creative Cloud apps like Photoshop and Illustrator benefits designers working across multiple media. While its auto-animate feature creates sophisticated micro-interactions, XD has lost market share to Figma due to weaker collaboration tools and no browser-based editing.  

* #### **Sketch**  
* The original disruptor in digital design tools, Sketch remains popular among Mac users for its symbol libraries and artboard templates. However, its macOS exclusivity and lack of robust cloud collaboration (compared to Figma) have diminished its dominance. Plugins help bridge some functionality gaps, but Sketch works best for solo designers in Apple ecosystems.  

* #### **Traditional Pen and Paper**  
* Despite digital advancements, sketching wireframes by hand remains valuable for lightning-fast ideation. Physical sketching encourages creativity before committing to digital tools and requires no technical skills. Many teams begin projects with paper prototypes before digitizing the best concepts.
